    <h1>Installing the SDK Commands</h1>
    <p>The Google App Engine SDK includes commands you can run from a command line window to start the local app server and upload your project to Google App Engine.  While many of these features are available in the Launcher, you can use the command-line interface to access advanced features or to access these features from scripts.</p>
    <p>To use the command-line interface to the SDK bundled with the Launcher, you must first install the commands.  The install procedure sets up symbolic links in <code>/usr/local/bin</code> that refer to the commands located in the Launcher's application bundle.</p>
    <p>For more information on these commands, see <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/">the Google App Engine documentation</a>.</p>
